## This repo contains LLD for Cache system in node js.

Run npm init to install dependencies and then npm start to start the server.  
Use npm test to run tests.  
Use npm test -t '{describeString} {itString}' to run specific test.

# Few imp links I referred to setup node js testing:

Useful for debugging:  
To run test in watch mode, update package.json as: "test": "jest --watch"  
To run specific test add f (focus in test) as fit instead of test/it.
